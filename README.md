# Outer Wilds Solar System Simulator

This is my first time using the pygame library.
It's a solar system inspired of the game Outer Wilds. Instead of the game, I used real life meters and equations to make simulated orbits of the planets.

Hourglass Twins is not working appropriately yet, I'll do some changes later.

Thanks for reading that!
